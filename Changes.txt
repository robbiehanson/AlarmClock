RELEASE CANDIDATE 1

Fixed "check for updates" link
Fixed bug where alarms go off, even if wake from sleep isn't selected
When selecting alarm to edit from the menu, windows only open up once now.
  (Before, if you selected an alarm from the menu, and it was already open, a new window would open anyways)
New alarms now use a default time of 8:00 AM.  I think this is less confusing than the current time.
Fixed bug that would occur when trying to schedule the computer to wake from sleep in the next 30 seconds or less
  (This is why many people claimed that the program would not wake their computer from sleep)
When an alarm goes off, the alarm window now loads much faster

	If you have alarms scheduled, the icon is blue
	If you have alarms scheduled, but don't have the app set to wake the computer from sleep, the icon is blue with red bells
Fixed a memory leak: Each time the alarm editor was opened a string and two dates were leaked.
Previously, alarms were only saved to user preferences when the program was quit from the item in the menu.
	Fixed this so that alarms are saved as you add, delete and edit them.

  This was a freak incident, that happend to me once over the course of months of testing.
  This meant that alarms would go off a minute late.
  This was actually a flaw in the OS or the NSTimer API, or some kind of freak situation.
  But it happend to me consistently on my computer one night...
  So I coded around the possibility of a small inacuraccy in the firing of a timer
Now automatically skips to next track in between snoozes
Implemented remote support for next track and previous track
